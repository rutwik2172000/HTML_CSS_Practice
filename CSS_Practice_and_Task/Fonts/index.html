   WEB DEVELOPMENT 
       What is Web Development? 
            Web development is the process ofcreating websites or web applications that are accessible through the internet. 
        Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications. 

    History of Web Development 
       The first web page was published on  6 August 1991 by  Tim Berners-Lee  of the European Organization for Nuclear Research, more commonly known as , CERN.
       The web page included information on the World Wide Web and outlined formats, protocols, and how you could create web pages.
